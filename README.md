# Google VR Walking Character Controller
## GvrWalkingCharacterController.cs
### By Sam Halperin

This script allows the user to walk around a VR scene
by swiping over the control surface of the GVR remote
as if it were a d-pad.

To get started, attach the script in this directory to the Player object
in a working GVR project, 
(see: https://developers.google.com/vr/develop/unity/controller-support)
or start with the GVR HelloVR demo scene.
